\abstract
The subject of this report is the creation of a program that factorizes numbers into their constituent primes and also different ways of doing so. The requirements of our program was that it had 15 seconds to factorize 100 numbers up to 100 bits in length using at most 32 MB of memory. Our solution used a combination of several methods to factorize integers, one of them were Pollard's rho algorithm. During the project we tried a few different variations but for our final version we used it together with Trial Division, Floyds Circle detection algorithm and Perfect Powers.
What we discovered were that Pollard's rho is good for the factorization of integers with small prime factors and that the most important feature of a program of this type, besides the algorithm itself, is to be able to control how the limited execution time is spent.

\section*{Statement Of Collaboration}
Both Henrik Sohlberg and Mårten Pålsson have participated equally in the process of finding a solution to the main problem of this project, how to factorize large numbers. Later in the process (the implementation phase) Mårten implemented the Trial Division method, Henrik implemented the Perfect Power and the Fermat
